# Adaptive vs Responsive Web Design – Usability Study

This repository contains the code and assets for my Bachelor's thesis at **FH Technikum Wien**.  
The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate the **usability differences between adaptive and responsive web design**.

## 🎓 About the Project

As part of my final thesis, I am developing two separate web implementations:

- One using **responsive web design** techniques
- One using **adaptive web design** principles

These implementations will be tested and analyzed in a **usability study** to compare how users interact with each approach on different devices and screen sizes.

## 🧪 Purpose

The main research question is:
> _"How do responsive and adaptive web design approaches differ in delivering effective usability when applied to devices such as notebooks and smartphones in the context of e-commerce websites (web-shops)? "_

By conducting user testing and collecting feedback, the study aims to provide insights into the practical implications of choosing one method over the other.

## 📁 Structure

- `/webshop-responsive` – Implementation using responsive web design (e.g., fluid grids, media queries)
- `/webshop-adaptive` – Implementation using adaptive web design (e.g., fixed breakpoints, server-side layout changes)
- `/backend` – Backend services used for both versions (e.g., API, user handling, session management)
- `/db` – Database schema, mock data, or migration scripts
